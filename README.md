In this project, I will be building a full dashboard design with HTML & CSS based on the design file from The Odin Project.

I will be practicing and demonstrating the HTML and CSS skills I have learned up until now.
As I have recently learned about CSS Grid, I will be applying my knowledge and practicing using CSS Grid within this project.

I am looking forward to getting more comfortable and adding CSS Grid into my toolbox as well as tackling any problems I face along the way.
